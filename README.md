# Lab 1-Portfolio

### Basic HTML programming expertise is an important skill for Computer Science graduates. Â 

##### In creating a web page you can think of the *Content Layer* as being the basic HTML. The *Presentation Layer* is the CSS, and the *Behavior Layer* as the javascript.

##### For this assignment, you'll need to create a web page portfolio that will showcase the different projects you have/will done. You can look at [freecodecamp portfolio project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) for an example of a portfolio, but you can do something much simpler. A major part of the assignment is to make your page look good, so make sure to spend some time on that.

### A portfolio should (and yours must) include at least the following sections defined in your index.html file in this repository:
- A brief about section (similar to a resume objective statement but with more information about you)
- Links to Projects you have completed (include at least 3, even if they're super simple HTML pages).  Write your own html pages to link to, dont link to existing html pages on other sites.
- A work experience section (This would be a good place for your lists)
- Links to sites like github and linkedin where someone could learn more

### Your page should have at least the following specific elements:

- lists (Ordered and Unordered with at least 2 items)
- different background colors for different sections (not each piece, but like header/footer/main content/etc)
- images (at least 2)
- links to other pages that you have written 
- heading styles that are defined in your CSS (in the file main.css provided in this repository)

### Your Page must also include:
- some basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript (like find an HTML element and change its color with a button to something else, or whatever you can find - try checking this <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp">tutorial</a>)
